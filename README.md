## What's Next

While the application is fully functional, there are areas targeted for improvement:

- **Unit Testing:** Adding tests to cover core functionalities.
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Introducing a policy to gracefully handle transient http faults.
- **Security Enhancements:** Improving password handling and storage.

These improvements were deprioritized due to time constraints and are slated for future development.
